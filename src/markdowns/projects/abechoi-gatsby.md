## Summary

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to my first Gatsby website! I had a lot of fun making it, and surprisingly, it was not as difficult as I had thought. I was fairly new to GraphQL as well, but luckily I was able to catch up to speed thanks to The Net Ninja, my favorite web developer on YouTube.

## Challenges

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this project, there were two instances where I was stuck for hours and had to seek external help. My first major issue was not fetching my query properly, by it's alias name. I used markdownRemark instead of my alias, and someone on StackOverflow had corrected me. My second issue, I thought had to do with gatsby-plugin-image, as my images would not load when deployed, but would load just fine for gatsby develop and build/serve, but it was an AWS issue. For some reason AWS Amplify would not load my images, so I tried AWS S3, still no luck. I've asked Reddit, Facebook Groups, StackOverflow, and even AWS Amplify's Github page (and I still didn't get a response from them). I then simply deployed my app via Netlify and configured my records on AWS Route 53 to point there.

## Takeaways

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, I thought this project was overly ambitious, but looking back, it wasn't too bad at all. The most time consuming part about this project, is the Mobile-First Responsive CSS. I suppose if you are comfortable with React, Gatsby isn't much different. Maybe structurally, but it's structured in such an organized way, there's nothing bad to say about it. GraphQL took a bit getting used to, but I find it even easier than SQL overall.

## Conclusion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a crucial project for my growth, in terms of developing confidence and skills. For my next project, I'm leaning towards Next(no pun intended). I have heard that it's harder than Gatsby, but if I can get familiar with it, I'll feel very complete as a React Developer. Maybe then, I can consider Angular or Vue.
