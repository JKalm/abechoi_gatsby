## Grand Opening!

Hello and welcome to my new site, built with using Gatsby. I wanted to understand Server-Side Rendering, and I had two options, Gatsby and Next. I went with Gatsby because from my understanding, if you're not making a lot of updates per second, Next is overkill. Also, Gatsby is supposed to be easier, so I'll take small steps towards the harder, more difficult technologies.

##

Deploying Gatsby has proven much more difficult than a simple React wesbite, for reasons I'm still not sure. Images just refuse load when deployed using AWS Amplify or S3. I've tried asking for help on Stack Overflow, AWS Amplify's Github, Reddit, and a Gatsby Facebook, but I was unable to find a solution, so I transferred my domain from AWS to Netlify and deployed it there. Now, it's up and running, and I just have to finish tidying up my css to make it mobile first.

## My Future Plans...

I want to stick to React for the moment, as I'm still learning new things every now and then. Once I become more comfortable to Gatsby and Next, I should probably focus my efforts on using Typescript. Then, I'm not sure if I want to go into React Native or Angular.
